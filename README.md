This is project number 6 for Technigo 2019. It was my first time working with an API and it was really fun. Learning by doing! This is my weather-app: https://project-weather-app-hippiekick.netlify.com/

# Short description of task: Build a Weather Web App :sunny:

This week's project is to build a simple weather web app that tells today's weather and temperature, and a weekly forecast using a weather API.
The web app, before stretch goals should look something along the lines of this:

**What you will learn ðŸ§ **

- What an API is and how to use it
- Basic JSON
- How to use fetch() in Javascript
- How to use promises in JavaScript
- How to work with the Date() object in JavaScript


**#1 Get started with the weather API.**

[Sign up for a free Open Weather Map account](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).

You will need to use the `fetch()` function in JavaScript to load the weather data into your page, and then select the values you want to inject into the DOM from the JSON which comes from the API.

**#2 Present some data on your web app**

Your task is to present the data: the city name, the temperature (rounded to 1 decimal place), and what type of weather it is (the "description" in the JSON)

**#3 Sunrise and sunset ðŸŒ‡**

Show the time for sunrise and sunset in a readable time format (Example: 13:00 or 1 PM). 
You will have to format the date from milliseconds to a readble format.

**#4 Weather forecast**

Show a forecast for the next 5-7 days. With min and max temperature and the description.

**#5 Style your weather app ðŸŽ¨**

Once you get the data onto your site, style it to look like ine of the provided designs.
